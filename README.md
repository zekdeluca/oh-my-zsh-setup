# oh-my-zsh Setup

Personal oh-my-zsh setup sample. Meant to allow quick oh-my-zsh configuration on different machines.

### Replicating the repository on a machine
- Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/username/reponame.git
    ```

- Symlink `.zshrc`:

    ```
    ln -sf <repo-complete-path>/repo-name/.zshrc <home-complete-path>/.zshrc (make sure to use fully qualified path to avoid issues with the symlink)
    ```
